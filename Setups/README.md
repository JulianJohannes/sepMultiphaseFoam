## Setups

We provide test case setups for convection and hydrodynamics for the **solvers**
* Basilisk
* OpenFOAM-interFoam
* OpenFOAM-interIsoFoam
* TwoPhaseFlow - interFlow-RDF
* TwoPhaseFlow - interFlow-fP
* Ansys Fluent

These include for *convection*
* 2D droplet in reversed diagonal flow
* 2D droplet in reversed vortex flow
* 3D droplet in reversed vortex flow

and for *hydrodynamics*
* 2D stationary droplet
* 3D stationary droplet
* 2D translating droplet
* 3D translating droplet
* 2D oscillating droplet (not used for paper)
* 3D oscillating droplet
* 2D oscillating wave

Please check out the Journal paper for detailed test case description or look into the case setups.

### Contribute
If you detect a bug or unexpected behavior while using this test suite, feel free to contact the authors. Since we benchmarked many solvers in which we are not proficient, we cannot guarantee the best performance. However, we are happy about all contributions since we aim to offer a reliable basis.
